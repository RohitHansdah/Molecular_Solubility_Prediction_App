This app predicts the **Solubility (LogS)** values of molecules! Data obtained from the John S. Delaney. ESOL:â€‰ Estimating Aqueous Solubility Directly from Molecular Structure. J. Chem. Inf. Comput. Sci. 2004, 44, 3, 1000-1005.

### Model Building Steps :

#### Step 1 : Importing Libraries and Dataset : 

Important python libraries used in the project are Scikit-Learn , Pandas , Numpy  and  Streamlit . The Training dataset was obtained from the John S. Delaney. ESOL
Dataset Link : https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dataprofessor/data/master/delaney_solubility_with_descriptors.csv

#### Step 2 : Data Preprocessing : 

In this step the missing values in the data were checked.

#### Step 3 : Exploratory Data Analysis :

In this step Feature Scaling of the data was done.

#### Step 4 : Model Training :

A **SVR** model was trained using the medical data.

#### Step 5 : Model Prediction and Evaluation :

The model predictions were made .**MSE and R-Squared** values were used for evaluation of the model.
