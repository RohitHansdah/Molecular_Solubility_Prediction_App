This app predicts the Solubility (LogS) values of molecules! Data obtained from the John S. Delaney. ESOL:â€‰ Estimating Aqueous Solubility Directly from Molecular Structure. J. Chem. Inf. Comput. Sci. 2004, 44, 3, 1000-1005.

### Model Building Steps :

#### Step 1 : Importing Libraries and Dataset : 

Important python libraries used were Scikit-Learn , Pandas , Numpy  and  Streamlit . The Training dataset was obtained from Kaggle website 
Dataset Link : https://www.kaggle.com/kumar012/hypothyroid?select=hypothyroid.csv

#### Step 2 : Data Preprocessing : 

In this step the missing values were handled using KNN imputer and unwanted columns from the dataset were removed.

#### Step 3 : Exploratory Data Analysis :

In this step Feature Scaling , Normalization and Over Sampling(Imbalanced Data) of the data was done.

#### Step 4 : Data Clustering  :

**KNN Clustering algorithm** was used to divide the Data into multiple clusters and the optimal number of clusters was decided using elbow method.

#### Step 5 : Model Training :

Each Cluster was trained on **K-Nearest Neighbours Classifier , Naive Bayes Classifier and Support Vector Classifier**.The model with better performance was choosen.

#### Step 6 : Model Prediction and Evaluation and Hyper parameter tuning:

The model predictions were made  on the test dataset and  Hyper parameter tuning was done using Grid Search CV .**ROC-AUC** score was used for evaluation of the model.
